"""
Property Management Chatbot - Main Application

This is the main FastAPI application entry point for the property management
chatbot system. It configures the application, includes routers, and sets up
global middleware and exception handlers.

Application Architecture:
- FastAPI framework for high-performance async API
- Modular router structure for organized endpoints
- Automatic API documentation via OpenAPI/Swagger
- Environment-based configuration support

Current Features:
- Conversation management API
- Automatic API documentation at /docs
- Health check endpoint
- CORS support (can be added as needed)

Future Enhancements:
- Authentication and authorization middleware
- Rate limiting for API protection
- Logging and monitoring integration
- Additional routers for users, chatbots, etc.
