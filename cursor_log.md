# Property Management Chatbot System - Development Log

## Project Overview

This project implements a REST API for a property management chatbot system that captures and qualifies leads from website visitors. The system enables property management companies to deploy AI chatbots on their websites to engage potential tenants and collect comprehensive lead information.

## Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI (Python 3.8+)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with asyncpg driver
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy with async support
- **Validation**: Pydantic models
- **Deployment**: Docker-ready with environment configuration

### Core Components

#### 1. Database Models (`app/models.py`)
- **User Model**: Represents potential tenants/leads
  - Supports anonymous users initially
  - Email uniqueness for deduplication
  - Lead source tracking for marketing attribution
  - Audit timestamps for lifecycle tracking

- **Chatbot Model**: AI assistants deployed on property websites
  - Property-specific configuration
  - Customizable appearance and behavior
  - Active/inactive status for deployment control
  - Widget embedding support

- **Conversation Model**: Records of user-chatbot interactions
  - Comprehensive lead qualification data
  - Tour booking information
  - Apartment preferences and requirements
  - Lead scoring and status tracking
  - JSON fields for flexible data storage

#### 2. API Schemas (`app/schemas.py`)
- **Legacy Schemas**: Backward compatibility support
  - `UserCreate`: Standalone user creation
  - `ConversationCreate`: Requires existing user

- **Modern Schema**: Streamlined integration
  - `ConversationCreateWithUser`: Atomic user and conversation creation
  - Automatic user deduplication by email
  - Support for anonymous users

#### 3. Database Layer (`app/db.py`)
- Async SQLAlchemy engine for high performance
- Connection pooling and session management
- Environment-based configuration
- FastAPI dependency injection pattern

#### 4. Business Logic (`app/crud.py`)
- CRUD operations for database entities
- Async/await pattern for non-blocking operations
- Error handling and validation

#### 5. API Endpoints (`app/routers/`)
- **Conversation Router**: Primary business logic
  - Combined user and conversation creation
  - Chatbot validation
  - Lead qualification data capture
  - Structured response format

- **User Router**: Legacy support
  - Standalone user creation
  - Backward compatibility

## Key Features

### 1. Atomic Operations
The system performs atomic user and conversation creation, ensuring data consistency. Either both records are created successfully, or neither is created if an error occurs.

### 2. User Deduplication
When a user provides an email address, the system automatically checks for existing users and reuses the existing record rather than creating duplicates.

### 3. Anonymous User Support
Users can start conversations without providing personal information. Data can be collected progressively as the conversation develops.

### 4. Comprehensive Lead Qualification
The system captures extensive lead qualification data including:
- Apartment size preferences
- Budget constraints
- Move-in timeline
- Household composition
- Pet information
- Desired features
- Tour booking requests

### 5. Flexible Data Storage
JSON fields allow for extensible data storage without schema changes, supporting evolving business requirements.

## API Design

### Primary Endpoint: `POST /conversations/`

This is the main integration point for chatbot systems. It accepts a comprehensive payload containing both user information and conversation data.

**Request Flow:**
1. Validate chatbot exists and is active
2. Search for existing user by email (if provided)
3. Create new user if none found
4. Create conversation with all qualification data
5. Return structured response with IDs and metadata

**Response Format:**
json
{
"conversation_id": "uuid",
"user_id": "uuid",
"user_email": "email@example.com",
"status": "new",
"lead_score": 0,
"is_new_user": true,
"message": "Conversation created successfully"
}


## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `SECRET_KEY`: For JWT tokens (if authentication added)
- `CORS_ORIGINS`: Allowed origins for CORS
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity

### Production Optimizations
- Disable SQL query logging (`echo=False`)
- Configure connection pooling
- Add rate limiting middleware
- Implement proper error handling
- Set up monitoring and logging

### Security Considerations
- Input validation via Pydantic
- SQL injection prevention via ORM
- CORS configuration for production
- Authentication/authorization (future enhancement)

## Integration Guide

### For Chatbot Developers

1. **Basic Integration**:
   ```python
   import httpx
   
   async def create_conversation(chatbot_id, user_data, conversation_data):
       payload = {
           "chatbot_id": chatbot_id,
           **user_data,
           **conversation_data
       }
       
       async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
           response = await client.post(
               "https://api.example.com/conversations/",
               json=payload
           )
           return response.json()
   ```

2. **Progressive Data Collection**:
   - Start with minimal data (chatbot_id only)
   - Update conversation as more information is collected
   - Use email for user deduplication

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Handle 404 errors (chatbot not found)
   - Handle 400 errors (validation failures)
   - Implement retry logic for 500 errors

### For Property Management Companies

1. **Chatbot Setup**:
   - Create chatbot record in database
   - Configure welcome message and appearance
   - Generate embed code for website integration

2. **Lead Management**:
   - Monitor conversation status changes
   - Set up notifications for qualified leads
   - Integrate with existing CRM systems
